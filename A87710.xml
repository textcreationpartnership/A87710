            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It is wiſdome which taſteth, then which there is nothing ſweeter to the underſtanding. Neither are they by any meanes to be thought wiſe, which ſpeake by word and not by taſte. And they ſpeake feelingly of wiſdome, which by it doe ſo know all things, that they know nothing at all; for by wiſdome, and in it, and of it, is all internall reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and taſte; but it, becauſe it dwelleth in the higheſt, is not taſtable by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh or taſte. Therefore it is untaſtably taſted, inaſmuch as it is higher then all taſtable, ſenſible, rationall, or intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And this is to taſte untaſtably, and afarre of, as if the ſmelling a thing ſhould be call'd an untaſtable fore-taſte; for as the odour multiplyed from the<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115053:8"/>thing that is odorable, taken or received by another, allureth us to the race, to runne to the oyntment in the ſmell of the oyntments; ſo the eternall and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdome ſhining in all things, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth us, by a certaine foretaſte of its effects, to be carried to it with a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull deſire: for whereas life it ſelfe is an intellectuall ſpirit, which hath in it ſelfe a certaine con-nate fore-taſte, whereby it doth, with ſo great deſire, ſearch for the fountain of its life which without that fore-taſte, it could neither feeke nor know it ſelfe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if it found it; hence it is, that it is moved to its proper life; for it is ſweet unto every ſpirit continually to aſcend to the principle or beginning of life, though it be unapprochable; for this is continually to live more &amp; more happily, to aſcend more and more to life; and when by ſeeking its life, it is brought thither, that it ſees it the infinite life, then it ſomuch more rejoyceth, by how much more it ſees its life immortall, &amp; ſo it comes to paſs, that the unapprochable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and incomprehenſibility of its life, is its moſt deſired and longed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, as if a man had a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115053:8"/>of his life, and ſhould come to this, that he knew that treaſure of his to bein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, unweighable, and unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, this knowledge of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibility is his moſt pleaſant and wiſht for comprehenſion, not as it relates to the comprehendor, but to the moſt lovely treaſure of his life; as if any man ſhould love any thing becauſe it were lovely, he would be glad, that in the lovely there ſhould be found infinite and inexpreſible cauſes of Love. And this is the lovers moſt joyfull comprehenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he comprehends the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible lovelineſſe of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; for he would not ſo much rejoyce to love any ſecond loved object, that were comprehenſible, as when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares unto him that the lovelineſſe of the thing beloved is utterly unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, undeterminable, and wholly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.

               <p>Seeing then this thy deſire is not but by the eternall wiſdome, in which and of which it is, and this happy life likewiſe, which thou deſireſt is not but from the ſame eternal wiſdome, in which it is, and without which it cannot be, hence it followeth that in all the deſire of intellectuall life, thou deſireſt nothing elſe then the eternall wiſdome, which is the complement of thy deſire, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, middle, and end thereof. If therefore this deſire of immortall life, that thou mayeſt live eternally happy, be ſweet unto thee, thou doeſt already finde within thy ſelfe a certaine fore-taſte of the eternall wiſdome; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſired that is utterly unknowne, as among the Indians there are apples, whoſe foretaſte becauſe we have not, we do not deſire them; but being we cannot live without nouriſhment; nouriſhment we deſire, &amp; of nouriſhment we have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fore-taſte that we may live ſenſibly;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115053:10"/>therefore a childe having a certaine fore-tafte of milke in his own nature, when he is hungry is moved unto milke; for we are nouriſhed, by thoſe things of which we are. So the underſtanding hath its life from the eternall wiſdome, and of that it hath (ſuch as it is) a certaine fore-taſte, whereupon in all feeding, which, that it may live, is neceſſary unto it, it is not moved but to be fed from thence, from whence it hath this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall being. If therefore in all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of intellectuall life thou wouldeſt marke from whom the underſtanding is, by what it is moved, and to what; thou wouldeſt finde in thy ſelfe, that it is the ſweetneſſe of eternall wiſdome, which makes thy deſire ſo ſweet and delightfull unto thee, that thou art carried with an unſpeakeable affection to the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it, as unto the immortality of thy life.</p>
               <p>And if thou looke upon the example of iron, and the load-ſtone, thou ſhalt finde that the iron hath in the load-ſtone a certaine beginning of his effluence, or flowing out; And whileſt the load-ſtone, by its preſence ſtirres up the heavy and<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115053:11"/>ponderous iron, the iron with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſire is carryed contrary to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature by which for its heavineſſe it ought to preſſe downwards, &amp; is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upwards by uniting it ſelfe to its principle: for except there were in iron a certaine naturall fore-taſte of the load-ſtone, it would no more be moved to the load-ſtone than to any other ſtone; and except there were in the ſtone a greater inclination to iron than to copper there would not be that attraction and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Our intellectuall ſpirit hath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly from the eternall wiſdome, a principle or beginning of being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectually, which being is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto wiſdome, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not intellectuall being. Hence the irradiation or immiſſion into a holy Soule, is in the ſtirring up a deſirefull motion: for he that by an intellectuall motion ſeeketh wiſdome, he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly touched to the fore-taſted ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, forgetting himſelfe, it is received in the body, as if he were without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the weight of all ſenſible things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold him untill he unites himſelfe to<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115053:11"/>the attracting wiſdome: and this makes the ſoule that by an amazing admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forſakes the ſenſe, growes ſo mad that it makes no account of ought elſe beſides that wiſdome, and to ſuch a one it is ſweete to leave this world, and this life, that they may the more readily be carried into the wiſdome of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>This foretaſte makes that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth delightfull, abominable to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, who the ſooner to attaine unto it, do moſt evenly and patiently beare all corporall torments. It inſtructeth us, that this our ſpirit being turned unto it, can never faile; for if this our body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any ſenſible ligament or tie, hold the ſpirit? but that letting go all perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of dutyes to the body, it is moſt greedily carried to that eternall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; then ſurely though the body faile, it can never faile; for this aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and likeneſſe, which is naturally in our ſpirit, by which it is not quieted but in that wiſdome it ſelfe, is, as it were, the lively image thereof; for the image is not quieted but in that whereof it is the image, and from which it hath<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115053:12"/>the beginning, midſt, and end; now the living image, by its life, doth of it ſelfe put forth motion towards the Sampler, in which onely it reſteth; for the life of the image cannot reſt in it ſelfe, being but the life of the life of truth, and not its owne; hereupon it is moved to the ſampler, as to the truth of its being. If therefore the ſampler be eternall, and the image have life in which it fore-taſteth its ſampler, and ſo be deſirefully moved unto it; and ſeeing that motion if it be vitall or lively, cannot reft but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite life, which is eternall wiſdome; hence it followeth, that that ſpirituall motion can never ceaſe which doth never infinitely reach or touch infinite life; for it is alwaies with a moſt pleaſant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire moved to reach it, which becauſe of the delightfulneſſe of the attraction is never loathed; for wiſdome is the moſt s;avoury meat, which ſo ſatisfieth, that it never diminiſheth the deſire of taking it, ſo that the delight of that eternall feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ceaſeth.</p>

               <p>Thou ſaiſt right, and it pleaſeth me well to have heard this word from thee, for as all knowledge of the taſte of that thing which was never taſted, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mpty and barren, untill the ſenſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting do reach it; ſo likewiſe of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which no man taſteth by hearſay, but he onely taſteth which receives it in his internall taſte, and he beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not of thoſe things he hath heard, but which he hath experimentally taſted in himſelfe. To know the many deſcriptions of love which the Saints have left unto us, without the taſte of love, is but a certaine emptineſſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for him that ſeekes eternal wiſdome, it is not ſufficient to know thoſe things which are read of it; but it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that having found by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding where it is, he then make it his owne, as he that hath found a field, wherein there is a great treaſure, cannot rejoyce in or enjoy that treaſure, being in another mans and not his owne field; therefore he ſelleth all and byeth that field, that he may have the treaſure in his<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115053:13"/>owne field; he muſt then ſell, and give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all his owne things; for the eternall wiſdome will not be had, but where the haver kept nothing of his owne, to the end he might have that; and that which we have of our owne, are our vices; and that which we have of the eternall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are nothing elſe but good things. Wherefore the ſpirit of Wiſdome dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in a body ſubject to ſinnes, nor in an evill willing ſoule. But in his own pure field and ſapientiall clean image, as in his holy temple; for where the eternall wiſdome dwels, there is the Lords field, bearing immortall fruit; for it is the field of vertues which wiſdome tilleth, from whence growe the fruits of the Spirit, which are Righteouſneſſe, Peace, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Temperance, Chaſtity, Patience and ſuch like.</p>

               <p>To ſay that God made all things in wiſdome, is no more to ſay, then that that God created all things by his word; but conſider how all that is might be, and might ſo be, and is, and God that gives it the actualneſſe of being, is he with whom there is power by which the thing might be produced from not being to being; and he is God the Father, which may be called Entity or Unity, becauſe he doth by his omnipotence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate that to be which was nothing; for God gives it ſuch a beeing, that it is this, (as heaven for example) and nothing elſe; neither more nor leſſe. And this God is the word, the wiſedom, the ſon of the Father; and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the equality of Unity, or Entity. Then there is a being; and being ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is, and this it hath from God, which is the connection knitting all things together; and it is God the holy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115053:14"/>Spirit, for it is the Spirit that unites and knits together all things in the univers, and in us. As therefore nothing begets unity but it is the firſt principle not principiated; or the firſt beginning not begun; ſo nothing begets the Father who is eternall; and equality proceeds from (or is begotten of) unity: ſo the ſon from the Father; and the knot or bond proceedeth from unity and its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality; ſo the holy ſpirit from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſonne; wherefore every thing, that it may have being, and ſuch a beeing in which it is, hath need of a unitrine principle; namely of God three and one, of whom there might much more be ſaid, if the time would give leave: the wiſedome therefore which is the equality it ſelfe of being is the word or reaſon of things; for it is as an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite intellectuall forme; for the forme gives to the thing that it is form'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an infinite forme is the actuality of al formable things &amp; formes, and the moſt preciſe equality of them all; for as if there were an infinite circle, it would be the true ſamplar of all figurable figures, and the equality of the being of every fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115053:14"/>for it would be a triangle, an hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agone, a decagone &amp; ſo forth; &amp; the moſt adequate meaſure of them all, though a moſt ſimple figure; ſo infinite wiſedome is ſimplicity, complicating all formes &amp; the moſt adequate meaſure of them all, as if the moſt perfect Idea of omnipotent art ſhould be the art it ſelfe, and moſt ſimple forme of every thing formable by art. So that if thou looke upon the form of a man thou ſhalt finde the forme of the divine art, the moſt preciſe ſamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler thereof, as if it were nothing elſe at all; then the ſampler of the forme of a man; ſo if thou looke to the forme of Heaven, and turn thy ſelfe to the forme of the divine art, thou ſhalt not be able to conceive it any other thing then the ſampler of this forme of Heaven. And ſo of all formes form'd or formable. The art or wiſedome of God the Father, is the moſt ſimple forme, and yet the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt equall example of infinite formable formes; although vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. O how admirable is that forme whoſe moſt ſimple infinity all formable formes cannot explicate, or ſhew the uttermoſt of? And he onely, that by a moſt ſublime underſtanding, lifteth<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115053:15"/>himſelfe above all oppoſition, ſees it to be moſt true; as if any man would marke the naturall force which is in a unity, he ſhould ſee that power, if he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame to be in act, as a cetaine forme viſible by the underſtanding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that afarre of; and becauſe the power of a unity would be moſt ſimple, it muſt needs be a moſt ſimple infinity. In the next place, if the fame man would turne himſelfe to the forme of numbers in conſidering a duality a or a tennality, and would then return to the actuall power of a unity, he ſhould ſee that forme which is put to be the actuall power of the unity, to be the moſt preciſe ſamplar of duality, tennality, or any other nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable number; for this would the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that forme doe (which is called the power of unity) that whileſt thou lookeſt to duality, that forme can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater nor leſſe, then the forme of duality, whereof it is the moſt preciſe ſamplar.</p>
               <p>Thus thou ſeeſt that one and the ſame ſimple wiſedome of God, becauſe it is infinite, is the moſt true ſamplar of all formable formes; and this is his reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115053:15"/>by which he reacheth all things, boundeth or limiteth, and diſpoſeth them; for it is in all formes as the truth in the image; the ſamplar in the thing exemplified; the forme in the figure, and preciſeneſſe in aſſimilation or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and although it doe moſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally communicate it ſelfe to all things a being infinitely good; yet can it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in nothing as it is, becauſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing it is otherwiſe received. And being it cannot be received in any thing, but after another manner, it is yet received after the beſt manner that may be; but unmultipliable infinity is better explicated in a various reception; for great diverſity doth better expreſſe unmultipliableneſſe; from whence it is that wiſedome being in divers formes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely received, brings it to paſſe that every forme called to Identity is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of wiſedome, as well as it can; that ſome things partake it in a certain ſpirit exceedingly diſtant from the firſt forme, which ſcarce gives an elementall being; others in a more formed ſpirit, which gives a minerall being; others in a yet more noble degree, which gives a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115053:16"/>life; others in a higher, which gives a ſenſible life; after that in ſuch a one as gives an imaginative power; then a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, and laſtly, an intellectuall life; and this is the higheſt degree that is, the neareſt image of wiſedome. And this onely is the degree that hath aptitude or fitneſſe to lift it ſelfe up to the taſte of wiſedome; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in thoſe intellectuall natures, the image of wiſedome is the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intellectuall life; the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is of it ſelfe to ſhow or put forth a vitall motion; which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by underſtanding to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to its proper object; which is abſolute truth, that is eternall wiſedome; and that going foreward being to uunderſtand, is alſo to taſte intellectaully; for to apprehend by the underſtanding, is by a certaine moſt welcome taſte as well as it can, to attains and reach to quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; for as by the ſenſible taſte which reacheth not the quiddity, yet in outward things there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pleaſant ſweetneſſe perceived by the ſenſe, which ſweetneſſe is<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115053:16"/>from the quidditie: So by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding there is taſted in the quidditie an intellectuall ſweetneſſe, which is the image of the ſweetneſſe of the eternall wiſedome, which is the quidditie of quiddities, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable compariſon of one ſweetneſſe to another.</p>
               <p>Let theſe things that have beene ſaid, ſuffice for this ſhort time, that thou mayeſt know that wiſedome is not in the art of oratory, or in great volumes, but in the ſeparation from theſe ſenſible things; and in the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt ſimple and infinite forme; and that thou mayeſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to receive it in a Temple purg'd from all vice, and by fervent love to cleave unto it, untill thou mayeſt taſte it, and ſee how ſweet that is which is all ſweetneſſe, which being once taſted, all things which now ſeeme great, will grow vild and baſe unto thee; and thou wilt be ſo humbled, that no arrogance, or any other vice will remaine in thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with a moſt chaſte and pure heart thou wilt inſeparably adhere<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115053:17"/>unto wiſedome once taſted; choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to forſake this world, and all things elſe that are not it, then it; and living with unſpeakeable gladneſſe, thou wilt dye; and after death eternally reſt in it by a moſt amorous embracement; which the ever bleſſed wiſedome of God it ſelfe vouchſafe to grant both to thee and mee. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>It is a very good inference; and add unto it, that God being infinite ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and abſolute neceſſity, a doubtfull queſtion reacheth not him, but all doubt is in him certainty; whence we alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that any anſwer unto any queſtion concerning God, is not a proper and preciſe anſwer; for preciſion is not more than one and infinite, which is God: for every anſwer partakes of the abſolute anſwer, which is infinitely preciſe. But what I ſaid unto thee, how that in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological queſtions, the preſuppoſed is the anſwer, muſt be underſtood in the ſame manner that the queſtion is made, and ſo taking it, this is ſufficiencie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whereas in God, neither the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, nor the anſwer to the queſtion, can reach preciſion: therefore after the manner wherein the queſtion approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to preciſion, in the ſame manner the anſwer preſuppoſeth.</p>
               <p>And this is our ſufficiencie which we have of God, knowing that preciſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attingible, cannot by us be reached, but<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115053:20"/>after ſome manner that partakes the manner of abſolute preciſion. Among the which, being divers and manifold, that partake the onely manner of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the foreſaid manner comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto abſolute facility, and is our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, becauſe we cannot reach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is eaſier and truer.</p>

               <p>That is, as we admit ſome things may be ſpoken of God affirmatively: for in that Divinity which denies all things of God, we muſt ſpeak otherwiſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115053:20"/>there the truer anſwer is to every queſtion, a negation: yet by that means or manner, we are not led to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what God is, but what God is not.</p>
               <p>There is moreover a conſideration of God, as neither poſition, nor ablation (that is neither affirmation nor negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) agrees unto him, but as he is above all poſition and ablation; and then the anſwer is, to deny affirmation, negation and copulation. As in caſe it ſhould be demanded, Whether God be? according to the way of poſition, it muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered out of that which is preſuppoſed, to wit, that he is, and that the very abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute preſuppoſed Entity: Bat accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the way of ablation (or negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) it muſt be anſwered, that he is not: when by that way, none of all thoſe things that may be ſpoken, can agree to him that is unſpeakable. But by the way, which is above all poſition and ablati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it muſt be anſwered, that he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to wit, abſolute Entity; nor that he is not, nor both together (namely that he is and is not) but that he is above all.

                  <hi>This conception, as</hi> I <hi>think, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the word of God,</hi> or the reaſon (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <p>But take it notwithſtanding, very brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preciſion, ſtraightneſſe, truth, juſtice &amp; goodneſſe (of which thou haſt heard) are the ſame thing: Yet do not beleeve that I mean, as all divinity is circular, one of the attributes verified of another; as we ſay, that from the neceſſity of Gods infinite ſimplicity, the greatneſſe of God is his power, and back again, his power is his greatneſſe: and ſo of all thoſe things that are by us attributed to the eſſence of God. But theſe things of which I now ſpeak, we find by experience, do coincide in our ordinary talk. For<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115053:22"/>when we hear any body expreſſe a thing as it is indeed, preſently one ſayes that the expreſſer did it preciſely, another rightly, another truly, another juſtly, another well. And thus we find it true in our dayly ſpeech. Neither doth he who ſaid he did it preciſely and rightly, mean any other thing, then he that ſaid he expreſſed it truly, juſtly, and well. And this thou granteſt in thy ſelf to be true, when thou markeſt how he that ſaid neither more nor leſſe than he ought to have ſaid, hath reached and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to all thoſe; for preciſeneſſe is no more to ſay than that which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe. In the ſame manner neither right, nor true, nor juſt, nor good, admit either more or leſſe; for how can that be preciſe, right, true, juſt, or good, that is leſſe than preciſe, right, true, juſt, and good? And if that which is leſſe than preciſe, be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and leſſe than right, be not right, and leſſe than true, be not true, and leſſe than juſt, be not juſt, and leſſe than good, be not good; it is manifeſt, as well that which admitteth more, is none of theſe: for preciſion which admitteth more, to<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115053:23"/>wit, which can be more preciſe, is not abſolute preciſion.

               <p>Thou ſayeſt true of thy face; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath quantity, and being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more or leſſe, it cannot be preciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither the adequate meaſure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. For in this world wanting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115053:24"/>preciſion, &amp; adequate meaſure; &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is impoſſible. But if thou conceive an abſolute ſamplar, it is otherwiſe; for that is neither great nor ſmall, for theſe things cannot be of the reaſon (or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality) of a ſamplar: for a Piſmire being to be painted, is a ſamplar as well as a mountain that is to be painted, and ſo back again: therefore an abſolute ſamplar, that is not capable of more or leſſe, being preciſion and truth, cannot be either greater or leſſe, than the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified: for that which cannot be leſſe, we call the leaſt, and that is moſt little; and that which cannot be greater, we call the greateſt, that is the moſt great. Abſolve therefore or free maximity or greateſtneſſe from that which is moſt little, or moſt great, that thou mayeſt ſee maximity in it ſelf, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in ſmall or great, and thou ſhalt ſo ſee abſolute maximity, before great and little, ſo that it cannot be greater or leſſe, but is the greateſt, in which the leaſt coincides.

               <p>Well then, though a circle, which is capable of more and leſſe, cannot be ſimply the greateſt, or infinite; yet let us ſuppoſe ſuch a circle to be infinite, ſhall not then the Diameter thereof be an infinite line?</p>

               <p>And the circumference being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſhall be the Diameter; for two infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites cannot be, ſeeing each of them, by the addition of the other, may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And the circumference it ſelf could not be crooked, for it were impoſſible it<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115053:25"/>ſhould be neither greater nor leſſe than the Diameter, if it were crooked; See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is one and the ſame habitude (or proportion) of the crooked circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of all circles to the Diameter, which is a habitude more than triple or threefold. If therefore the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be equal to the Diameter, it ſhall alſo be the Diameter it ſelf and a right line. For this cauſ alſo thou ſeeſt, how the Arc of a great circle, is liker to a right line than the Arc of a little circle: And therefore by this reaſon, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of an infinite circle, muſt needs be right or ſtraight: whence it is manifeſt, that crookedneſſe which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of more or leſſe, is not found in the infinite, but onely rightneſſe or ſtraightneſſe.</p>

               <p>This thou clearly diſcerneſt by thy ſelf, that infinit rightneſſe hath it ſelf ſo (or is of the ſame habitude) to all things; as an infinite line, if there were<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115053:26"/>any ſuch, hath it ſelf to all figures; for if infinite rightneſſe, which is neceſſarily abſolute, were contracted to a line, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contracted, it muſt needs be found the complication, preciſion, rightneſſe, truth, meaſure and perfection of all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurable figures. Therefore abſolute rightneſſe being conſidered abſolutely, and uncontractedly to any line, or any other thing whatſoever, is likewiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the ſamplar, preciſion, truth, meaſure and perfection of all things.</p>

               <p>Thou haſt heard how an infinite line is a circle, ſo a triangle, quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, Pentagone; ſo all infinite figures co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with an infinie line. Hereupon, an infinite line is the ſamplar of all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures which can be made of lines; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an infinite line is an infinite act or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115053:26"/>form of all formable figures. And when thou lookeſt upon a triangle, and lifteſt thy ſelf up to an infinite line, thou ſhalt find it the moſt adequate ſamplar of this triangle; after this maner conſider an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite triangle, this infinit triangle is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater nor leſſe than the aforeſaid triangle. For the ſides of an infinite trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle are infinite, and an infinite ſide being the greateſt, in which the leſs coincides, is neither greater nor leſſe than the given ſide. So then the ſides of an infinite tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, are neither greater, nor leſſe than the ſides of the given triangle. So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole triangle is greater or leſſe than the given triangle; wherefore it muſt needs be, that an infinite triangle is the preciſion, and abſolute form of a finite triangle. But the three ſides of an infinite triangle, muſt of neceſſity be one infinite line; becauſe there cannot be many infinite lines: So it would come to paſſe, that an infinite line is the moſt preciſe ſamplar of the given triangle: and as I have ſaid of a triangle, ſo likewiſe of all figures.</p>

And I ſee that in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of its ſtraightneſſe, all things figurable, are complicitely, moſt truly, formally, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, without all confuſion, or defect, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more perfectly than be they can figured.</hi>

               <p>Bleſſed be God, who hath uſed me, a moſt ignorant man, as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as it is, to open the eyes of thy mind for the beholding him with admirable eaſineſſe, after the manner that he hath made himſelf viſible unto thee; for when thou transferreſt thy ſelf from ſtraightneſſe contracted to a line, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute infinite ſtraightneſſe, then in that ſtraightneſſe thou ſhalt ſee complicated, every thing formable, and the kinds of all things, as I have ſaid before of figures. And thou ſhalt further ſee, how ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf is the ſamplar, preciſion, truth, meaſure or juſtice, goodneſſe or perfection of all things, which are or can be; and the preciſe and unconfoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded actuality of all things that are, or are poſſible to be made; ſo that to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115053:27"/>kind or thing being, thou turneſt thine eyes, if thou lift up thy mind to infinite ſtraightneſſe, thou ſhalt find it the moſt preciſe, and no way defective exemplar truth thereof. As put the caſe thou ſee a man, which is ſtraight, and a true man, thou ſhalt ſee that he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that ſtraightneſſe, truth, meaſure and perfection, So contracted and terminated is a man. And if thou conſider his ſtraightneſſe which is finite, and lift up thy ſelf unto infinite ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thou ſhalt ſtraight ſee how infinite and abſolute ſtraightneſſe can be neither greater nor leſſe than that ſtraightneſſe contracted to a man, whereby the man is a ſtraight and true man, but is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, juſteſt, and beſt preciſion thereof. So infinite truth is the preciſion of finite truth; and abſolutely infinite, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, meaſure, truth and perfection of every thing finite.

                  <p>If then this be ſo, is not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſolute beginning infinite? For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a beginning there is no beginning,<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115053:34"/>as appears by it ſelf, leſt the beginning ſhould be principiated.

For I do not in theſe imitate the figure or ſhape of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing whatſoever: for ſuch forms of Spoons, diſhes and pots, are perfected by mans art alone; and therefore my art is rather perfecting than imitating created figures, and in this liker un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to infinite Art.</p>

                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>Suppoſe then that I would expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my art, and make ſenſible the form of Spoonneſſe, by which the Spoon is conſtituted, which though in its own nature, it be by no ſenſe attingible, as being neither white nor black, nor of any other colour, ſound, ſmell, taſte, or touch, yet if I will labour to make it ſenſible in that manner that it may be done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the divers motions of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I uſe, I do bore and make<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115053:35"/>hollow the matter, that is wood, untill in it the due proportion ariſe, wherein the form of ſpoonneſſe doth convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear. Whereupon the truth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of ſpoonneſſe, which is unmulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable, and incommunicable, cannot by any inſtrument, or any man be made perfectly ſenſible. And in all ſpoons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſimple form it ſelf, after a divers manner, more in one, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſe, but in none preciſely. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wood it ſelf takes the name from the comming of the form, that as ſoon as that proportion ariſeth, in which ſpoonneſſe appeareth, it is called a ſpoon, that ſo the name may be united to the form; yet the impoſition of the name was at pleaſure, becauſe another might have been impoſed. And though it be at pleaſure, yet it is not another, and quite divers, from the natural name united to the form, but the naturall name ſhines (after the comming of the form) in all the divers names by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever divers nations impoſed. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the name therefore is done by the motion of reaſon; for the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of reaſon is about things which fall<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115053:35"/>under ſenſe, whoſe diſcretion, concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and difference reaſon makes. So that there can be nothing in reaſon, which was not firſt in ſenſe. So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſon impoſeth names, and is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give one name to one thing, and another to another. But becauſe the form in its truth, is not found among thoſe things about which reaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, therefore reaſon ends it ſelf, and determines in conjecture and opinion. Whereupon generals and particulars,
<hi>genera &amp; ſpecies,</hi> as they fall under names, are <hi>(Entia rationis)</hi> beings of reaſon which reaſon made to it ſelf, out of the concordance and difference of ſenſible things: &amp; in that reſpect, being by nature after the ſenſible things whereof they are the ſimilitudes, the ſenſible things being deſtroyed, thoſe cannot remain. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore, thinks that nothing can fall into the underſtanding, that falls not into reaſon, he alſo thinks that there can be nothing in the underſtanding that was not firſt in the ſenſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he muſt neceſſarily ſay, that the thing is nothing, but as it falls under a name, and his ſtudy is in every inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115053:36"/>deeply to ſearch after the <hi>quid nominis,</hi> quiddity of the name. And this enquiry is very pleaſing unto man, becauſe it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth by the motion of reaſon. This man would deny that forms in themſelvs &amp; in their truth ſeparated, are otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they are beings of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; would make no account of ſamplars, and Ideas.</p>
                  <p>But they that admit ſomething to be in the intelligence of the mind, which was not either in ſenſe or reaſon; as for example, The exemplar and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable truth of forms which ſhineth in the ſenſible things, they ſay that the ſamplars or Ideas do by nature, go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenſible things, as the truth goes before the image; And this order they give, that firſt, according to the order of Nature, is humanity in it ſelf, and of it ſelf, namely without any praejacent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then man by Humanity, and that he falls under a name, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſpecies in reaſon: and that therefore all men being deſtroyed, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity as it is a ſpecies, that falls under a name, and is a being of reaſon which reaſon hath found out, by the ſinilitude and likelineſſe of men, cannot ſubſiſt;<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115053:36"/>for it depended of men which are not; but for all this, that humanity by which men were, doth not ceaſe to be, which humanity falls not under the name of ſpecies, as names are impoſed by the motion of reaſon, but is the truth of that ſpecies that falls under a name: whereupon though the image be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the truth remains in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And all theſe deny that the thing is nothing but as it falls under a name; for in that manner as it falls under a name, Logick and reaſonable diſcourſe conſiders of them, and accordingly they do logically enquire into the nature of the thing, and commend this way of ſo doing; but they reſt not there, becauſe reaſon or Logick is onely converſant about the images of the forms. But they that labour Theologically to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matters beyond the power of the name, turn themſelves to ſamplars and Ideas. And beyond theſe I think there can no more wayes of inquiſition be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If thou that art a Philoſopher, haſt read other, thou mayeſt peradventure know them; but this I think.</p>

                  <p>All theſe, and what differences of wayes ſoever may be imagined, are eaſily agreed, when the mind lifts it ſelf up to infinity: For (as this Oratour can more at large inform thee, by what he hath heard of me) the infinite form is the one onely and moſt ſimple which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in all things, as the moſt adequate ſamplar of all and every thing formable. Whereupon it ſhall alſo be moſt true, that there are not many ſeparate ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars and Ideas of things, which infinite form no reaſon can reach: therefore being unſpeakable, it is not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all names impoſed by the motion of reaſon. And ſo the thing as it falls under a name, is the image of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, proper, and adequate ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar. There is therefore one unſpeakable word, which is the preciſe name of all things, as by the motion of reaſon they fall under a name; which unſpeakable name, after its manner, ſhineth in all things, being the infinite nominability of all names, and the infinite word of all things poſſible to be by word expreſſed;<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115053:37"/>ſo that every name is the image of the preciſe name; And this was all which they all laboured to ſay, though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it might have been better and clearlier ſpoken: for they all neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed, that there is one infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which we call God, in which all things muſt needs be complicated. Nor did he mean any other thing, that ſaid humanity as it fals under a name, is the preciſion of truth, then that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able infinite forme, which, while we looke upon the forme of man we call the preciſe ſamplar thereof; that ſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, whileſt we look upon the images thereof, may be named by the name of all things, and one moſt ſimple ſamplar according to the ſpecificall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of things exemplified, and by our reaſon formed may ſeeme to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſamplars.</p>

And therefore when I would make tryangularity viſible, I make a figure, in which I make three Angels, that in that figure ſo habituated and proportioned, triangularity may appear, whehewith the name is united, which let it be ſuppoſed to be a Trigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; I ſay then if Trigonus be the preciſe name of a tryangulare figure, then I know the preciſe names of all polygo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or many corner'd figures; for then I know that the preciſe name of a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangulare figure ought to be a Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone; and of a five corner'd figure a Pentagone, and ſo forward: And by the knowledge of one name, I know the figure named and all polygones that may be named, and the differences and concordances of them, and whatſoever elſe in this point may be known. In like manner I ſay that if I knew the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe name of one worke of God, I ſhould know all the names of all the workes of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115053:39"/>God, and whatſoever might be known; And ſeeing the name of God is the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of every name nameable, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that in that name alone all and every thing may be knowne.</p>

                  <p>Thou knoweſt how Divine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity complicates all things; of this complicating ſimplicity, the mind is the image: it then thou ſhalt call this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine infinite ſimplicity, mind, it ſhall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115053:39"/>be the ſamplar of our mind. If thou call the Divine mind the univerſality of the truth of things, thou ſhalt calours the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality of the likeneſſe of things, that it may be the univerſality of notions. The conception of the Divine mind, is the production of things, the conception of our mind, the notion of things. If the Divine mind be abſolute entity, then the conception thereof is the creation of beings: and the conceptions of our mind the likeneſſe of beings; for thoſe things that agree to the Divine mind, as to infinite truth, agree to our mind as the neareſt image of truth. If all things be in the Divine mind, as in their preciſe and proper truth; all things are in our mind, as in the image, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of their proper truth, to wit, notionally; for knowledge is by like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. All things are in God, but there the ſamplars of things; all things are in our mind, but here the ſimilitudes of things. As God is the abſalute entity, which is the complication of all things that are, ſo our mind is the image of that infinite entity, which is the complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all images, no otherwiſe then the <pb n="76" facs="tcp:115053:40"/>firſt picture of an unknown King, is the ſamplar of all other copies that are painted according to it: for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or face of God, deſcends not, but in the mentall nature, whereof truth is the object; and further it deſcendeth not, but by the mind, ſo that the mind is the image of God, and the ſamplar of all the images of God after it ſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look how much all things, after the ſimple mind, do partake of the mind, ſo much do they alſo partake of Gods image; ſo that the mind of it ſelf is the image of God, and all things after the mind, no wayes but by the mind.</p>

                  <p>I doe indeed for that which is to be ſaid, cannot conveniently be expreſſed, &amp; therefore is the multiplication of ſpeech very profitable. Now marke further, than an image is one thing, and an explication another; for equality is the image of unitie, for from unitie once ariſeth equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Therefore is equality the image of unitie; yet is not equality but plurality, the explication of unitie : therefore is equally the image of the explication of of unity, not the explication. So doe I meane, that the minde is the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple image, of the divine minde, amongſt all the images of divine complication. And ſo is the minde the firſt image of that divine complication, which by his ſimplicity and power, complicateth all images of complication. For as God is the complication of complications, ſo the minde which is the image of God, is the image of the complication of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications: and after the images, are the plurality of things which explicate the divine complication. As number ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115053:41"/>unity, motion reſts, time eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, compoſition ſimplicity, time the preſent, greatneſs a point, motion a moment, inequality equality, diverſity identity, and ſo of the reſt. From hence gather the admirable power of our minde, for in the vertue thereof, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the aſſimulative power of the complication of a point, by which it finds in it ſelf a power, wherein it aſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it ſelfe to every greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p>So alſo becauſe of the aſſimulative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the complication of unity, it hath power to aſſimulate it ſelfe to every mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And ſo by the aſſimulative power of the complication of now or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it hath power aſſimulate it ſelfe to all time; and ſo by the aſſimulative power of th complication of reſts, to all motion; and of ſimplicity to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and of identity to all diverſity; and of equality to all inaquality, and of conjunctionto every diſ-junction. And by the image of the abſolute complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the infinite minde, it hath power by which it can aſſimulate it ſelfe to every explication: and many ſuch things thou ſeeſt of thy ſelfe, may be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115053:41"/>ſaid, which our mind hath, becauſe it is a certaine image of the infinite ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which complicateth all things.</p>

                  <p>Undoubtedly our mind was, by God, put into this body, to the profit and advantage thereof; and therefore it muſt needs have from God all that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it could not acquire that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage, it is not therefore cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that there were notions concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſoul, which it loſt in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but becauſe it hath need of a body, that the concreated power may proceed unto act. As the viſive power of the ſoul cannot ſee actually, except it be ſtirred up by the object; and that cannot be, but by the repreſenting of multiplied ſpecis by then eſn of the organ, and ſo it hath need of the eye. Even ſo the power of the mind, which is the comprehenſive and nationall power, cannot porceed to its opperations, except it be ſtirred up by ſenſible things, which it cannot be but by the mediation of ſenſible phantaſmis. Therefore it hath need of an organicall body, and ſuch an one, without which it could not be ſtired up. In this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to have thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that there are no notions of the ſoul concreated from the beginning, which it loſt by being incorporated. But<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115053:42"/>becauſe it cannot profit, if it want all udgement, as a deaf man can never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to become a luteniſt, becauſe he hath in himſelf no judgement of harmony, by which he may diſcerne whether he do profit, therefore our ſoul hath a concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated judgement without which it could not profit. This judging power is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concreated with the mind, by which, of it ſelf it judgeth whether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes be weak, ſtrong, or concluding. Which power if <hi>Plato</hi> called a concreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notion, he was not out of the way at all.</p>

                  <p>How clear is thy delivery, which every man that hears, is forced to aſſent unto.

                  <p>By this we prove, that the mind is that power which though it want all notionall form, yet being ſtired up, can aſſimilate it ſelf to every form, and make<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115053:43"/>notions of all things: like, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to a ſound eye which is in darkneſs, and never ſaw the light, for it wanteth all actuall notion of viſible things; yet comming into light, and being ſtirred up, it aſſimilates it ſelfe to the thing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that it may make a notion.</p>

                  <p>So when the ſight confuſedly ſees great and little, is there not need of the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judgement of the underſtanding; what is great, and what little? but if the ſence were of it ſelf ſufficient, there would no recourſe be had to the judgements of the underſtanding, as in the ſight of that which is light, when there is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented which is contrary to it.</p>

                  <p>I would make a glazed ſpoon: I ſought out firſt a wood exceeding hard and cloſe: I applyed my inſtruments, and I wrought out a convenient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which the form of a ſpoon did perfectly appear: afterwards I poliſh'd the ſurface of it ſo, that in the ſhining form of a ſpoon, I made the forme of a glaſſe, as thou ſeeſt, for though it be a faire ſpoon, yet withall it is a glazed<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115053:47"/>ſpoon. For thou haſt in it all kind of glaſſes, namely concave, connext, ſtraight and calumnare, in the baſe of the handle ſtraight glaſſe; in the handle it ſelf a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnar; in the concavity of the ſpoon a concave glaſſe; and in the convexity a convex one. The glaſſie form, then, had no temporall being before the ſpoon, but to the perfection of the ſpoon, it was by me added to the firſt form of the ſpoon that it might perfect it: ſo that now the ſpecular form containes in it ſelf the form of the ſpoon, and yet the ſpecular form is independent of the ſpoon; for it is not of the eſſence of a glaſſe to be a ſpoon. Therefore though the proportions were broken, without which the form of a ſpoon cannot be; as put caſe the handle were ſeperated from it, it would ceaſe to be a ſpoon; but yet the form of a glaſſe would not ceaſe to be. Even ſo God by the motion of the heaven, out of fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath brought a proportion, wherein animality might ſhine, after a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner, whereunto he afterwards added the mind, as a living glaſſe by the means which I have ſaid.</p>

                  <p>Whether I be a Pythagorean or no, I know not; this I am ſure of, that no mans authority moves me, though ſometimes it offer to do ſo. But I thinke the Pythagoreans, which, as thou ſayeſt, do Philoſophize all things by numbers, very grave and witty men. Nor do I<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115053:48"/>believe that they meant our mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call number, which proceeds from our mind, for it is manifeſt, that cannot be the beginning of any thing; they ſpeak ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically and rationally, of the number which proceeds from the Divine minde, of which mathematicall number is but the image. For as our mind is in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that eternall infinite mind; ſo the number of our mind, to the number of that mind; and we give that number our name, as we give to that mind, the name of our mind; and we are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to be converſant in number, as in our own proper worke.</p>

                  <p>There can be but one infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and this alone is infinitely ſimple. But the firſt thing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated, or that hath a beginning, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be infinitely ſimple (as appears by it ſelf) neither can it be propounded of other things compounding it; for then it were not the firſt thing that had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but the things that compound it, muſt in nature go before it. We muſt<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115053:48"/>therefore admit, that the firſt thing that had a beginning, is ſo compounded, that yet it is not compounded of other things, but of it ſelf: and our mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend how any ſuch thing ſhould be, except it be number, or as the number of our mind. For number is compounded, and compounded of it ſelf, (for ſo eaven and odd, is every number compounded) ſo, number is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it ſelf. If thou ſayeſt that the third number is compounded of three unities, thou ſpeakeſt as though one ſhould ſay, that the wales and the roof, do ſeverally make an houſe: for if the wals be a part, and the roof a part, a houſe is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of them, nor more do three u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities apart, make the number three. Therefore if thou conſider unities as they conſtitute a ternary, thou conſidereſt them united, and that then three unities united are nothing but a ternary; and ſo it is compounded of it ſelf, and ſo of all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Nay that which is more, while in number I looke upon nothing but unity, I ſee an uncompounded compoſition of number, and a coinſidence of ſimplicity and compoſition, or of unity and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115053:49"/>yea, if I yet look more ſharply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, I ſee a compounded unity of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as in the harmonicall unities, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſon, diapente, diateſſaron: for an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical habitude is a unity, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number cannot be underſtood. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, from the habitude of a ſemitone, and a doubled mediety, which is as the habitude of the ſide of a ſquare to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiter, I ſee a more ſimple number, then the reaſon of our minde can reach unto. For habitude (or proportion) is not underſtood without number, and yet that number muſt be at once both odd and even, of which, a long diſcourſe, and very pleſant might be made, if we did not make haſt to other things. We have now therefore learned, how the firſt thing that was begun, is that whereof number beares the Type. Nor can we by any other meanes come nearer the quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity thereof, ſeeing the preciſion of the quiddity of whatſoever thing it it be, is by us utterly inattingable, otherwiſe then in an enigma or figure. For the firſt thing that had a beginning, we doe ſymbolically call number, becauſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the ſubject of proportion, for<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115053:49"/>there can be no proportion without number. And proportion is the place of the form; for without a proportion fit and agreeable to the form, the form can in no caſe ſhine or appear, as I ſaid, that the proportion befitting a ſpoon, being broken, the form cannot remain, becauſe it hath no place: for proportion is as it were the aptitude of the ſpecular ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the reſplendence of the image, which not abiding, the repreſentation ceaſeth. Behold how the infinite unity of the ſamplar, cannot appear but in an apt proportion, and that is in number. For the eternall mind doth act, as a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian which would make his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſenſible; for he takes many voices, and brings them into a proportion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to that harmony, that in that proportion, the harmony may ſweetly and perfectly appear, when it is there as in its place, and the reſpendence of the harmony is varied according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the proportion that is fit for it; and the harmony ceaſeth, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of that proportion ceaſeth. From the mind therefore is number and all things.</p>

                  <p>Yes; but it is from the Divine mind; wherefore as in regard of God, plurality of things is from the Divine mind; ſo in regard of us, plurality of things is from our minds: for onely the mind numbers, and the mind taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there is no diſcrete number. For in that the mind doth ſingularly and particularly underſtand one and the ſame thing , we when we conſider it, ſay it is one thing: in that it doth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly underſtand one thing, and that once, it is in truth the equality of unity. But when it underſtands one thing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, and by multiplying it, we judge the things to be more, in ſaying two: becauſe the mind underſtandeth that which is ſingularly one and the ſame thing, twice, or by doubling it.

                  <p>Becauſe from that the Divine mine underſtands one thing ſo, and another thing otherwiſe; the plurality of things ariſeth. Therefore if thou look narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into it, thou ſhalt find the plurality of things to be nothing but the Divine minds manner of underſtanding: So I conjecture one may without blame ſay, that the firſt ſamplar of things, in the mind of the Creator, is number.

                  <p>Likewiſe, ſay I, that the ſamplar of the conceptions of our mind, is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: for without number it can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If there were no number, there would neither be aſſimilation, notion, diſcretion, nor meaſure. For without number things cannot be other and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or diſcrete: nor can it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how one thing ſhould be ſubſtance, another quantity, and ſo of the reſt. Therefore ſeeing number is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of underſtanding, nothing can be without it underſtood. For the number of our mind, being the image of the Divine mind the ſamplar of things, is the ſamplar of notions. And as unity is before all plurality, and this unity uniting is the uncreated mind, in which all things are one; after one plurality, the explication of the power of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which power is the entity of things, the equality of being, and the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of entity and equality; and this is the bleſſed Trinity: So in our mind is the image of that Divine Trinity : for our mind is likewiſe a unity uniting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all plurality by the conceptible mind; and after that unity that unites
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115053:51"/>all plurality, is plurality, which is the image of the plurality of things; as our mind is the image of the Divine mind: and plurality explicates the power of the unity of the mind, which power is the image of entity, equality and connexion.</p>

                  <p>When thou conſidereſt that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is made of the multitude of unities, and that alterity doth contingently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low multiplication; and markeſt the compoſition of number to be of unity and alterity, the ſame and divers, even and odd, diviſible and indiviſible: And that the quiddity of all things had its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from being the number of the Divine mind; then thou mayeſt after ſome faſhion reach unto it, how the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of things are incorruptible, as unity, whereof is number, which unity is entity.

Inſomuch that every number proportion, and harmony which proceeds from our minde, doth as little reach or come near our minde, as our minde doth to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite minde. For the minde, though it be a divine number, yet it is ſo a number, that it is a ſimple unity, by its own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er putting forth its number.

In all thoſe places our minde, is carried in the ſpirit of the Arteries; vvhich being ſtir'd up by mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vvith ſpecies multipli'd from the objects to the ſpirits, aſſimilates it ſelfe by the things to the ſpecies; that by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilation it may give judgement of the objects: Whereupon that ſubtile ſpirit of the Arteries, which is enlivened by the minde, is ſo by the minde conform'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſimilitude of the ſpecies, which was objected to the motion of the ſpirit; As ſoft wax is by a man, having the uſe and art of the minde, configured unto the thing then preſently preſented to the work-man: for all configurations whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the art of carving, painting, or<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115053:54"/>hammering, cannot be done without the mind, for it is the mind which terminates all things. Therefore if we could imagine a piece of wax inform'd by the minde; then the minde being within it, would configure it, or make it like to every figure preſented unto it; as now the minde of the Artificer, being applied from without labours to doe. So likewiſe of clay, and every flexible or faſhionable thing. So in our body, the minde according to the various flexibleneſſe of the ſpirits of the Arteries in the Organs, makes divers configurations, ſubtile and groſſe; and one ſpirit is not configurable to that, to which another is; becauſe the ſpirit in the optick nerve, cannot be met withall, and incountred by the ſpecies of ſounds, but onely by the ſpecies of colours; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is configurable to the ſpecies of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and not of ſounds, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe another ſpirit which is configurable to all ſenſible ſpecies, which is in the Organ of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, but after a groſſe and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, or undiſtinguiſhed manner. And there is another in the Organ of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinative,<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115053:55"/>or diſcurſive power, which is configurable to al ſenſible things, diſcret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly. And all theſe configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are aſſimilations to ſenſible things, when thy are done by the meanes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſpirits, though never ſo ſubtile; wherefore, when the minde makes theſe aſſimilations, that it may have the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſenſible things, and ſo is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the corporall ſpirit, then it act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as the ſoul animating a body, by which animation the power of a living wight is conſtituted.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon the ſoul of brute beaſts makes the like aſſimilation after its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (though more confuſed) that it may after its manner attaine to notions.</p>
                  <p>But our power of the minde, from ſuch notions as theſe ſo elicited &amp; drawn out by aſſimilation, makes Mechanick arts phyſicall and logicall conjectures, and reacheth things in the manner, whereby they are conceived in the poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or matter, and in the manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the poſſibility of being, or matter is determined by the forme. Wherefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by theſe aſſimilations it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none but the notions of ſenſible<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115053:55"/>things, where the formes of things are not true, but ſhadowed with the variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of matter: therefore all ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are rather conjectures then truth; for this cauſe I ſay that the notions which are reached by rationall aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are uncertain, becauſe they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the images of formes, then the truths. Afterwards our minde, not as drowned in the body which it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, but as it is the minde of it ſelfe; yet in poſſibility of being united to the body, while it lookes unto its immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, makes aſſimilation of formes, not as they are drowned in the matter, but as they are in and of themſelves, and conceives the immutable quiddities of things, uſing it ſelfe for an inſtrument, without any organicall ſpirit. As whilſt it conceives that a circle is a figure, from whoſe center all the lines drawne to the circumference are equall: after which manner of being, a circle without the minde, cannot be in matter; for it is impoſſible there ſhould be given in matter two equall lines; and it is leſſe poſſible, that ſuch a circle ſhould be figured; and therefore a circle in the<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115053:56"/>mind, is the Samplar and meaſure of the truth of a circle in the pavement. So wee ſay that the truth of things in the minde, is in the neceſſity of complexion; to wit, after the manner that the truth of a thing requireth, as we have ſaid of the circle. And becauſe the minde, as in it ſelfe, and abſtracted from matter, makes theſe aſſimilations, therefore it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilateth it ſelfe to abſtracted formes. And according to this power it ſhewes or puts forth certain mathematicall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and finds its power to bee that it can aſſimilate it ſelfe to things, as they are in the neceſſity of complexion, and make notions; and it is ſtirred up to theſe abſtractive aſſimilations, by the Phantaſmes or images of formes, which it layes hold on by the aſſimilations made in the Organs. As by the beauty of an image, one is moved to enquire the beauty of the Samplar; and in this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation the minde is, as if abſolute pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe, abſtracted from Wax, Clay, Mettals, and all other flexible things, were living by a mentall life, that it could of it ſelfe aſſimilate it ſelfe to all figures, as they ſubſiſt in themſelves, and<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115053:56"/>not in the matter; for ſuch flexibility, in the power of its living flexibility, that is in it ſelfe, would behold that the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all things are, in as much as it could conforme it ſelfe to all things. And becauſe the minde is not yet ſatisfied with this, becauſe it ſees not the preciſe truth of all things, but in a certain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity determined to every thing, as one thing is ſo, and another thing ſo, and every thing compounded of its parts: and it ſees that this manner of being is not the truth it ſelfe, but the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, that one is truly ſo, and another thing truly otherwiſe, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity cannot agree to the truth in it ſelf, in its ſelfe, conſidered in its owne abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and infinite preciſion: whereupon the minde looking to its ſimplicity, to wit, as it is not onely abſtracted from matter, but incommunicable to matter, or after the manner of a forme not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, uſeth this ſimplicity as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may aſſimilate it ſelfe to all things, not onely abſtractedly, but alſo in its ſimplicity incommunicable to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And after this manner it behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things in its ſimplicity; as if it<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115053:57"/>ſhould ſee all greatneſſe in a point, and a circle in the center: and there it ſees without all compoſition of parts, and not as this is one thing, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but as all things are one, and one all things. And this is the beholding of abſolute truth, as if one could, after the laſt-before-ſpoken manner, behold how entity it ſelfe, is in all beings variouſly participated. And if after this he could in the manner (of which we now ſpeak) above participation, and all truth, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply behold abſolute entity it ſelfe; ſuch a one might truly, above the determinate neceſſity of complexion; now ſee all things which earſt hee ſaw in varietie, without it, in abſolute neceſſity, moſt ſimply without number, greatneſſe, and any alterity. And in this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, the minde uſes it ſelfe, as it is the image of God, and as God; which is all things, ſhineth in it, namely, when, as the living image of God, it doth with all its power, turne it ſelfe to its Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar. And in this manner, it ſees all things one thing, and it ſelfe the aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that one thing, by which it frames notions of the one, that it is all<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115053:57"/>things, and ſo makes Theologicall ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: where, as in the end of all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it ſweetly reſteth, as in the moſt delectable truth of its life; of which manner, there can never be enough ſaid; but theſe things which I have thus ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without curioſity, and after a plain manner, thou maiſt by thy elegant ſtile make more polite, and wel-come to the reader.</p>

                  <p>When it makes the ſimilitudes of things: or, if thou hadſt rather ſay, notions, or kinds, differences, ſpecies, proper, and accident. For God created in the ſoul the power of conceiving, and<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115053:58"/>the mind doth the things aforeſaid; yet are all theſe one and the ſame thing, the power of the mind, conception, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, notion, kind, and ſpecies. And although we do not call it the ſame thing to underſtand and to conceive, yet whatſoever is underſtood, is conceived, and whatſoever is conceived is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: but onely that which is actuall is underſtood, and not conceived.</p>

                  <p>To conceive is nothing but to comprehend either after the manner of matter, or form, or ſome other way; but that which is actually, is ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; that is, the property of it is comprehended by the mind. The mind is alſo ſaid to underſtand, by which it is moved, and the beginning of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rather called paſſion; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it, underſtanding. But as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition and habit are the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering a diſpoſition tends to perfection, and after perfection is a habit; ſo the paſſion of the mind and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are one and the ſame thing.</p>

                  <p>Thou ſayeſt well; properly the mind is ſaid to underſtand when it is moved; although it be not called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but after perfection.</p>

                  <p>They are ſo the ſame, that the power of conceiving is not any of them: becauſe it is called a power, from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which it hath from its creation; a conception, from the imitation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it imitates the matter or forme, namely, in that it comprehends after the manner of the matter or form of the compound.</p>
                  <p>And in what reſpect it is called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, in the ſame alſo it is called the ſimilitude or notion of the thing; and theſe names are truly predicated one of another, and every one of them is called underſtanding.</p>

                  <p>Although the conception be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from imitation, and underſtanding from perfection, yet it is perfection,<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115053:59"/>which is the cauſe why underſtanding is called conception: for then doth the mind conceive, when the underſtanding is lead to perfection.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>

                  <p>Yes that I will; for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is the motion of the mind, the beginning whereof is paſſion.</p>

                  <p>It follows not, as thou ſeeſt of thy ſelf. In like manner although the kinds and ſpecies be the underſtanding, yet are they not therefore paſſions of the ſoul; for the paſſions of the ſoul vaniſh, and yet the kinds and ſpecies of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>

                  <p>I ſhould be glad if I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe any part of that which I have heard. That which thou required is thus: The Naturaliſts ſay, that the ſoul is mixt with a moſt thin and ſubtile ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſcattered clean through the Arteries; ſo that, that ſpirit is the carryage of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115053:60"/>ſoul; and the vehiculum or carryage of that ſpirit, is the blood. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one nerve or artery full of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is directed to the eyes, ſo that near unto the eyes it is forked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with that ſpirit, it comes to the bals of the eyes wherein is the apple; that ſpirit then ſo diſperſed through the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the inſtrument of the ſoul, by which it exerciſeth the ſenſe of ſeeing; Two arteries full of the ſame ſpirit, are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the eares; likewiſe to the noſtrils, and to the palate, are certaine arteries directed; and that ſpirit is diffuſed by the marrow even unto the extremities or ends of the joynts. That ſpirit which is directed to the eyes is moſt active and nimble: and therefore when it finds any outward objects, the ſpirit is repercuſſed or ſtricken back, and the ſoul is ſtirred up, to ſee that which it meets withall. So in the ear it is repercuſſed with the voice, and the ſoul excited to comprehend: and as hearing is done in a moſt thin aire, ſo is ſmelling in a thick or rather fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous aire, which when it entreth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, by its ſumoſity retards the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo that the ſoul is excited to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115053:61"/>the odour of that fumoſity. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when a ſpongious humour enters the palate, the ſpirit is retarded, and the ſoul excited to taſte; So the ſoul u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſpirit diffuſed through the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for the inſtrument of touching: for when any ſolid thing meets with the body, the ſpirit is offended, and after a manner retarded, and thence is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. About the eyes, the ſoule uſeth a fiery power, about the ears an aethere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or rather a pure ayrie one; about the noſtrils a thick and fumous ayrie one; about the palate, a watery power; about the marrow, an earthy one; And this according to the order of the foure elements. That as the eyes are higher then the eares, ſo the ſpirit which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the eyes, is higher and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and may after a manner be called fiery. So that in man, the diſpoſition of the ſenſes is in a manner like the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the order of the four elements, whereupon ſeeing is ſwifter then hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore we ſee the lightning before we hear the thunder, although they be both at once. Moreover the ſtrong ſubtile and acute direction of the<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115053:61"/>beams of the eyes, makes the aire give way unto it, and nothing can withſtand it, except it bee groſſe, earthy, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Seeing then the ſpirit is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſenſes, and the eyes, noſtrils, and other ſenſories, are as windowes and wayes by which that ſpirit may go out to perceive, it is manifeſt that nothing is perceived but by a let or obſtacle, that (as ſoon as any thing hinders it) that ſpirit which is the inſtrument of percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may be retarded, and the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were retarded, may confuſedly by the ſenſes comprehend the thing that hinders it. For the ſenſe, of it ſelf, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates nothing: and if when we ſee any thing, we put a bound in it, that is not the worke of the ſenſe, but of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination which is joyned to the ſenſe. There is moreover in the fore part of the head, in the phantaſticall cell, a certain ſpirit much more ſubtile and nimble then that which is diffuſed through the Arteries, which when the mind uſeth as its inſtrument, it is made more ſubtile, that though the thing be abſent, it can comprehend the form in the matter, which power of the ſoul is called imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115053:62"/>becauſe by it, the ſoul conforms unto it ſelf the image of the thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and it differs in this from the ſenſe, becauſe the ſenſe comprehends the form in the matter, onely while the thing is preſent; but imagination doth it as well, when the thing is abſent, but confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that it diſcernes not the ſtate, but comprehends many ſtates together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly. But there is in the middle part of the head, to wit, in that cell which is called rationall, a moſt ſubtile ſpirit, thinner far then that in the fantaſticall cell, and when the ſoul uſeth that ſpirit as her inſtrument, it is yet more ſubtible, inſomuch that it diſcerneth ſtate from ſtate; yet doth it not comprehend the truth of things, becauſe it comprehends formes mingled with matter; but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confounds the thing formed, ſo that the truth of it cannot be comprehended. And this power of the ſoul is called rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. After theſe three manners the ſoul uſeth a corporall nſtrument. By it ſelf the ſoul comprehends, when it takes it ſelf into it ſelf (or retires into it ſelfe) ſo that it uſeth it ſelf for an inſtrument, as we have heard from thee.</p>

                  <p>The mind makes a point to be the terme of a line, and a line the terme of a ſurface; and the ſurface, it makes the number of the body; therefore multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115053:63"/>and magnitude are from the mind, and ſo it meaſures all things.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe a line is the joyning of one point to another, or the terme of a line. Therefore when thou wilt thinke a line, thy mind may conſider in it ſelf the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the two halfs thereof; which if it do, it will be a line of two points, becauſe of the two termes thereof, and the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the two halfs which the mind hath propounded to it ſelf. Nor are they divers kinds of points, the terme of a line, and the joyning; for the joyning of the two halfs, is therefore the terme of the lines. And if the mind give unto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther half its proper terme, it will be a line of four parts. So by how many parts ſoever the fore-imagined line bee divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, look how many termes there are of thoſe parts, of ſo many points ſhall the ſaid line be judged to be.</p>

                  <p>Neither many points, nor many unities; but ſeeing a point is the terme of a line, it may everywhere be found in the line: yet there is in it but one point, which being extended is a line.</p>

                  <p>True; yet for the variableneſſe of the matter which is under it, there is there a certaine extenſion. As there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one unity, yet is number ſaid to conſiſt of many unities, becauſe of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of thoſe things that are ſubjects to unity. A line therefore is the evolution (or flux) of a point; ſo is a ſurface of a line, and ſolidity of a ſurface: ſo that take away a point, and all greatneſſe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; take away unity, and all multitude faileth.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>By evolution I mean explication, which is nothing elſe then for a point to be in many atomes, ſo that it is in every of them conjoyned and continued. For<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115053:64"/>it is one and the ſame point in all atomes (or indiviſibles) as one &amp; the ſame white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all things that are white.</p>

                  <p>What doeſt thou underſtand by an atome?</p>

                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>According to the conſideration of the mind, that which is continued is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into that which is ever diviſible: and multitude (or number) increaſeth into infinity. But dividing them actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we come to a part, which is actually indiviſible, which I call an atome: For an atome is a quantity, which for its lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe is actually indiviſible. So in the conſideration of the mind, multitude hath no end, which yet notwithſtanding is actually terminated: for all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of things fals under a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate number, though to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Is a point the perfection of a line, being it is the terme thereof?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>It is the perfection and totality thereof, which complicates in it ſelfe a line. For to point a thing is to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it, and where it is terminated, there it is perfected; and the perfection thereof, is the totality of it. Therefore<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115053:65"/>is a point the terme of a line, and its to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and perfection, which complicates in it ſelfe a line, as a line explicates a point. For when I ſay in Geometry, that the totall perfection of a line, is from this point, A unto B, then before the drawing of the line, from A to B. by by the points A. B. have I already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the totality of the line, namely that the line muſt not be drawne out any further. Therefore that which actually, or intellectually is to include the totality between this, and this; that it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate a line in apoint. And to explicate it, is to draw a line particularly from A to B. and ſo a line explicates the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a point.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I had thought a point had been the complication of a line, as unity is of number; becauſe as there is nothing in number but unity, ſo there is nothing in a line, but a point everywhere.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>Thou haſt not ſaid amiſſe. It is the ſame thing in divers words; and the ſame manner of ſpeaking, mayſt thou uſe in all complications; for motion is the explication of reſt, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found in motion but reſt. So now,<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115053:65"/>(or the inſtant) is explicated by time, becauſe there is nothing found in time, but nows or inſtants. So of the reſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>How ſayeſt thou, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in motion but reſt?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe to move, is to fall from one ſtate to another; for as long as a thing is in one ſtate, it is not moved, and ſo there is nothing found in motion but reſt. For motion is a departure from one; therefore to be moved, is a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from one, unto another one: So that to paſſe from reſt to reſt, is to bee moved. And to be moved, is nothing but an ordered reſt, or reſt ſucceſſively ordered.</p>
                  <p>He doth much profit himſelfe, that ſeriouſly conſiders complications, and their explications; eſpecially, how all complications are images of the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of infinite ſimplicity, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications thereof, but images, and are under the neceſſity of complexion. And the minde, the firſt image of the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of divine ſimplicity, by its owne power, comprehending the power of theſe complications, is the place or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the neceſſity of complexion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115053:66"/>thoſe things that truly are, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the variableneſſe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are not materially but mental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; whereof already ſufficiently.</p>

                  <p>That it may reach its owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for the minde is a living meaſure, which by meaſuring other things, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its owne capacity. For it doth all things, that it may know it ſelfe.

                  <p>Thou ſayeſt the truth; for the part is not knowne, except the whole be knowne; for the whole meaſureth the part. For when I doe cut a Spoon out of the wood by parts, one piece after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, while I fit every part, I looke to the whole, that ſo I may make a well proportioned Spoon; ſo that the whole<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115053:68"/>Spoon which I have conceived in my minde, is the Samplar which I have an eye unto, while I frame every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Therefore it muſt needs be that to the knowledge of one Spoon, there proceeds the knowledge of the whole, and of the parts thereof. Wherefore if God, who is the Samplar of the univerſe be not known, there is nothing of the whole univerſity of things known; and if the univerſity bee not knowne, it is manifeſt that nothing can be knowne of the parts thereof.

                  <p>For the reaſon aforeſaid; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Arithmetick, and muſick is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the power of numbers, from whence is had the deſcription of things;<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115053:68"/>and in Geometry and Aſtronomy, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Doctrine of greatneſſe, from whence flowes all the comprehenſion of the whole being, therefore can no man Philoſophize without the quadrivium.</p>

                  <p>I doe not think he did, but that all that is, falls under greatneſſe or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, becauſe the demonſtration of all things is made according to the power, of the one or the other; for magnitude terminates, multitude diſcerns. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the definition which terminates and includs the whole being, hath the power of magnitude, and pertaines unto it; and the demonſtration of definitions, is neceſſary according to the power of magnitude; but diviſion, and the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of diviſions according to the multitude; moreover the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſyllogiſmes, are made according to the power, both of multitude &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. For that of two propoſitions, the third is concluded, it is of multitude; but that it conſiſts of univerſals and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, it is of magnitude. Hee that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115053:69"/>had more leaſure then we have, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deduce from hence, how quantities and qualities, &amp; the other predicaments, which give us the notice of things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from multitude; but how this is done, it is hardly known.</p>

Therefore, whereas order ſaith that could-be-made precedes, therefore is unity attributed unto it, in which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is precedence: &amp; unto could-make is attributed equality, which preſuppoſeth unity; from both which is the bond or knot: and let theſe things, if ſo it ſeem good, be ſufficient of this matter.</p>

                  <p>Onely one thing more, and that<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115053:71"/>is, whether God do underſtand as three and one?</p>

                  <p>The eternal mind underſtandeth all things in the unity of unity equality, and the bond of both: for how ſhould God underſtand even in eternity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſucceſſion, without entity, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of entity, and the knot of both? which are Trinity in unity. Not that God pretermits ſomething after the manner of matter, or underſtands by ſucceſſion, as wee do; but his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, being his ſtanding, eſſence, is neceſſarily in a Trinity.</p>

                  <speaker>Thil.</speaker>
                  <p>Now add unto it, whether it be ſo alſo in our mind, after the manner thereof?</p>

                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>I hold for certaine, that all things principiated or begun, hold in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the likeneſſe of their principle or beginning; and that therefore in all things is found a trinity in unity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, after the likeneſe of the true Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and unity of ſubſtance, of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall beginning. In all things therefore which are principiated, there muſt needs be found the could-be-made, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from the infinite power of unity,<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115053:71"/>or abſolute entity; the could-make, which deſcends from the power of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute equality, and the composition of both, which deſcends from the abſolute bond. Whereupon our mind, the image of the eternal mind, in that eternal mind as the ſimilitude in the truth, labours to find out its own meaſure: For our mind is to be conſidered as a high power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it is the ſimilitude or the Divine mind: in which mind of ours to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be aſſimilated, to be able to aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and the knot of both, are in eſſence one and the ſame thing. Therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not our mind, except it be one in Trinity, underſtand any thing, no more then the Divine mind. For firſt whileſt it moves it ſelf that it may underſtand, it premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſomething in the likeneſſe of could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be made or matter, whereunto it joyns another in the likeneſſe of could-make or forme; and then in the likeneſſe of that which is compounded of them, both, it underſtands. And whileſt it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends after the manner of matter, it akes kinds; whileſt after the manner of forme, it makes differences; and whileſt after the manner of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115053:72"/>it makes ſpecies or individuals.</p>
                  <p>So alſo whileſt it underſtands after the manner of a proper paſſion, it makes things proper; &amp; whileſt after the manner of ſomething adventitious, makes acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And it underſtands nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it knit it together by ſome manner of matter premiſed, another manner of forme comming upon it, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the compound. And in this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, wherein I ſaid ſome things are premiſſed after the manner of matter and forme, thou feeſt our mind underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the ſimilitude of the eternall mind: for the eternal mind underſtands all things together, and after all manner of underſtanding, without ſucceſſion. But ſuccceſſion is a deſcent from eternity, whoſe image and ſmilitude it is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it underſtands in ſucceſſion, whileſt it united to the body which is ſubject to ſucceſſion. For this is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to be noted, that all things, as they are in our mind, are together in matter, in forme, and in the compound.</p>

                  <p>The things thou ſpeakeſt, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delightfull; but that which thou ſaidſt laſt, was ſo attentively to be noted,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115053:72"/>I pray thee expound more plainly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>Very willingly. Look upon this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is an animal, or living wight: for ſometimes the minde comprehends it as it is a Genus, or kind, and then it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of a living wight as it were confuſedly, and unformedly after the manner of matter: ſometimes it conſiders it as it is expreſſed by the name of humanity, and that is after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of formes; ſometimes after, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thing compounded of that kind or Genus, and the differences that come unto it, and being ſo in the mind it is ſaid to be in connexion. So then, that matter, and that forme, or rather that ſimilitude of matter and forme, and that which is conſidered after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the compound, is one and the ſame notion, and one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. As when I conſider an animal, as matter; and humanity as forme coming upon it, and the connexion of them both, I ſay that matter, that forme, and that connexion is one ſubſtance. Or whilſt I conſider colour as the matter, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as the forme comming to it, and the connexion of both, I ſay that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115053:73"/>that form, &amp; that connexion of that matter and that form are one &amp; the ſame accident. And in like manner in al things.</p>
                  <p>Norl et it move thee, that when the minde makes ten moſt generall kinds, the firſt beginnings, that then thoſe moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall have no common Genus or kinde, which may, as matter be premiſed unto them; for the minde can conſider a thing, after the manner of matter; and the ſame after the manner of the form coming to it; and the ſame after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the compound: as whilſt the mind conſiders the poſſibility of being ſubſtance or any other of the ten predicaments (for it may rationally be ſaid, that manner is the poſſibility of being, either ſubſtance, or accident) and the minde conſiders the ſame as forme comming upon it, as it is matter; and as it is compounded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſubſtance, or any other of the ten. So that thoſe three are one and the ſame moſt generall. In that univerſity therefore of things, which is in the mind, all things are in trinity, and in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of trinity, after the ſimilitude, as they are in the eternal minde.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe ten moſt generals, are not in themſelve, but in the minde, and are underſtood after the manner of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after the manner of the forme, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the compound; yet in their inferiours, they are conſidered to have theſe manners of beings. Neither if thou rightly marke, can they in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without the minde, be either after the manner of the matter, forme or compound, which thou ſhalt eſpecially finde true when thou obſerveſt, how quality as it is in it ſelf an accident, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be but in its inferiours. So as ſpeciall, or particular ſtate, as it is in the minde, after the manner of matter; it may peradventure be ſaid, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered, being the, (ſpeciall, and individuall ſtate is the ſame, being ſundry wayes conſidered.

                  <p>That will be eaſie for thee to ſee, if thou note that all things as they are actually, are in matter, forme, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. For this nature, humanity, as it is a poſſibilty of being man, is matter. as it is humanity; it is forme; and as it is man compounded of them both, it is the connnexion: ſo that one, and the ſame thing, is both poſſibility of being man, the forme, and the compounded of them both, and there is one nature of the thing. Likewiſe alſo this nature, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the name of whiteneſſe, as it is a poſſibility of being whiteneſs, it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the ſame otherwiſe taken, is forme, and the ſame in the compound of them both; but ſo, as that that matter, that forme, and that compound of both is by nature the ſame quality.</p>

And therefore though we cannot well ſay humanities, yet we ſay men, becauſe the thing underſtood after the manner of the matter, or of the compound, is diviſibly underſtood: for our mind is the power of comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the whole virtual, compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the virtues of comprehending: and therefore every manner, being a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part thereof, is verified of the whole mind.

                  <speaker>Id</speaker>
                  <p>I affirme (as thou heardeſt) that the mind is the underſtanding; but how there ſhould be one mind in all men I cannot conceive. For the mind having an office by which it is called die ſoul, doth therefore require a convenient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of the body adequately proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unto it; which as it is found in one body, is not to be found in another. As therefore the identity of proportion is unmultipliable; ſo is the identity of the mind, which without an adequate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the body, cannot animate For as the ſight of thine eye, could not be the ſight of any other, though it were ſeperated from thine eye, and joyned to anothers eye, becauſe it could not find the ſame proportion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye, that it had in thine; ſo neither the diſcretion which is in thy ſight could be the diſcretion in the ſight of another. So neither could the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115053:77"/>of that diſcretion, be the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of an others diſcretion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude it not poſſible that there ſhould be one underſtanding in all men.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe number ſeemes to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, when the variableneſſe of the matter is taken away (as appears by that I have already ſaid) and that the nature of a mind, out of the body is free and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited from all variety of matter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be that the Platoniſts ſaid that our ſouls are reſolved into one ſoul, which is the common comprehender of all ours. But I do not think this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution true: For although we cannot underſtand how number ſhould be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, when the variety of matter it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; yet for all this, that purali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things ceaſeth not, which is the number of the Divine mind. Therefore the number of ſeperated ſuſtances, is no more, unto us a number, then it is, no number, becauſe it is ſo numerable by us, that yet it is neither even nor odd; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great nor ſmall; nor doth it in any thing agree with a number numerable by us. As if any man ſhould hear an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great voice, made by a mighty<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115053:77"/>army of men; and yet he ſhould not know that it was an army that made it; it is manifeſt that in the voice which he hears, every mans voice is different and diſtinct; though he that heard it, could not give judgement of the number, and therefore judgeth it to be one voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath no means to reach the number. Or as if in one chamber many candles were burning, and the chamber enlightned by them all, yet the light of every candle remaines diſtinct from the light of another, as we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they are carried out of the room one after one, becauſe the light is diminiſhed when every one that is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, carrieth his light with it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe therefore, that the burning candles in that chamber ſhould be all put out and yet the light remaine, and that one ſhould come into that chamber ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, he although he ſaw the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe of the chamber, yet cannot be poſſibly reach the diſtinction and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lights; nay he could not conceive, how there ſhould be plurality of lights there, except he knew that there were the light of many candles put out;<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115053:78"/>and if he did know this, namely that there were many, yet he could never nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically diſcerne or diſtinguiſh one light from another. The like examples thou mayeſt bring in the other ſenſes and help thy ſelf how the impoſſibility of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical difference, may, in regard of us, ſtand with the knowledge of plurality: but he that ſhall more diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how natures abſtracted from all variety of matter, that is any wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligile by us: yet in regard of God, who is infinitely abſolute, are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply abſtracted from all change, ſeeing they may be by him changed and lead into deſtruction, in as much as God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth according to his nature, dwell in imortality; be ſees withall that no creature can poſſibly eſcape the number of the Divine mind.</p>

                  <p>It may be <hi>Plato</hi> meant, that the ſoul of the world, is as the ſoul of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that knows the mind of his Lord, and executes his will; and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115053:79"/>he called notions or ſamplars, which are never defaced by oblivion, that the execution of the Divine providence may not faile. And that which <hi>Plato</hi> cals the knowledge of the ſoul of the world, <hi>Ariſiotle</hi> would have to be the ſagacity of nature, which had underſtanding to fulfill the will of God. Therefore to that ſoul of nature, they attributed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of complexion, becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately neceſſitated ſo to doe, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity commandeth; but that is nothing but the manner of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, namely when our minde concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God as the Architectonicall Art, whereunto there is another art of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſubordinate, that the divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception may proceed into being: but in aſmuch as all things do neceſſarily obey the will of the almighty, therefore the will of God needs no other executor, for in omnipotence willing and doing do coincide: As a glaſſe-maker, whileſt he makes glaſs, blows in a breath which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes his will; in which breath is the word or conception, and the power; for unleſſe the power and conception of the glaſſe-maker were in the breath which he<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115053:79"/>ſends forth, there would not ariſe, or be made, ſuch a glaſſe. Conceive therfore an abſolute creative art, ſubſiſting by it ſelf, that the art may be the workman, and the maſtery the maſter; this art hath in its eſſence neceſſarily, omnipotence, that nothing can reſiſt it; wiſdome, to know what it doth; and the connexion of omnipotence with wiſdom, that what it willeth may be done. That connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having in it ſelf wiſdome and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence is the ſpirit, as it were, will, or deſire; for of things impoſſible, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unkown, there is neither will nor deſire. So in the moſt perfect will, there is wiſdome and power, and by a certain ſimilitude; it is called a ſpirit, becauſe motion is not without, ſpirit; inſomuch that whatſoever cauſeth motion in the mind, and all things elſe, we call a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And by motion, all men do what they will do. Therefore the power of a creative art, which is an abſolute and infinite art, or the bleſſhed God, doth all things in his ſpirit or will, in the which is the wiſdome of the Son, and the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence of the Father, that his worke may be of one individed Trinity. Of this<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115053:80"/>connexin, ſpirit, or will, the
<hi>Platoniſts</hi> were ignorant, which did not ſee this ſpirit to be God, but thought it to be principiated by God, and to be the ſoul of the world, as our underſtanding ſoul animates our body. Nor did the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks ſee this ſpirit which thought this power to be nature hidden in all things, from which is motion and reſt, when indeed it is God abſolute bleſſed for evermore.</p>

                  <p>Thou haſt already heard of this matter; but becauſe variety of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, makes that which in it ſelf is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, ſomewhat more clear, I will obey thee. Behold, thou knoweſt that our mind is a certaine power having the image of that Divine art we ſpake of. Therefore all things which are moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Divine art, are truly in our mind, as the image thereof. Therefore our mind is created by that creating art, as if that art would create it ſelf. And becauſe that infinite art is un-multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115053:80"/>it behooveth that there ariſe an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereof even as if a painter would paint himſelf, and himſelf being not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyable by painting himſelf, there ſhould riſe his image.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe an image, how perfect ſoever (if it cannot become more and more perfect, and conformable to the ſamplar) is never ſo perfect, as any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect image, which hath power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it ſelf more and more without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to the unapproachable ſamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for in this the image, after the beſt manner it may, doth imitate infinity. As if a painter ſhould make two pictures of himſelf; whereof the one being dead, ſhould ſeem actually more like him; but the other ſhould be alive, and though for the preſent, leſſe like, yet ſuch a one, as being by its object ſtirred up to motion, could alwayes make it ſelf more and more conformable to the ſamplar; no man would doubt that this ſecond pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture were more perfect, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the art of the painter: So every mind, yea even ours, though created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath all others, hath from God, that as well as it can, it is a perfect, and living<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115053:81"/>image of the infinite art. Therefore it is three and one, having power, wiſdome, and the connexion of both, after ſuch a manner, that as a perfect image of the art, being ſtirred up, it can more and more conforme its ſelf to its ſamplar; So that our mind, though in the beginning of its creation, it have no actuall reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the creating art, in Trinity and unity: yet it hath that concreated pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that being ſtirred up, it can make it ſelf more and more conformable to the actuality of the Divine art. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the unity of its eſſence, is power, wiſdome, and will: And in-its eſſence do coinſide the maſter, and the maſtery, as in a living image ot the infinite art, which being ſtirred up, can all wayes without end, make it ſelf more and more conformable to the Divine actuality, the inacceſſible preciſion of the infinite art alwayes remaining.</p>

                  <p>Be this ſo: But tell me why all the Philoſopers ſay, that every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is of ſubſtance and accident; how is this true of God, and the firſt matter?</p>

                  <p>The underſtending concerning God, is an inflexion from the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this name, <hi>Ens,</hi> or being: becauſe the being of not being, that is being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>participably underſtood is God: And this underſtanding is the ſame, with that which is of ſubſtance and accident, but another way, that is inflexly conſidered. Wherefore the underſtanding conſerning<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115053:83"/>God, comprehends all underſtandings of ſubſtance and accidents, but is ſimple and one; but the underſtanding which had ot the firſt matter, is a certain bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that which is had of a body, for if thou underſtand abody un-bodily, that is, without all corporeal formes, thou underſtandeſt the ſame thing which ſignifies a body, but after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, becauſe un-bodily which is without doubt, the underſtanding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>I thinke ſome Angells intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectible, as thoſe of the higheſt orders; ſome intelligentiall as of the ſecond, ſome rationall as of the third; and that in every order there are likewiſe ſo many degrees, that there are in the whole nine degrees, or quires; and that our mindes are ſo beneath the loweſt degrees of ſuch ſpirits; and above every degrees of corporall nature, that they are, as it were, the connexion of the univerſity of things; the terme of perfection of the<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115053:84"/>lower nature, and the beginning of the higher. For I thinke that the mindes of the bleſſed ſpirits that are without bodies, doe in reſt poſſeſſe invariable notions; and ſuch as are not by any oblivion to be defaced, becauſe of the preſence of the truth, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly offers it ſelf by way of object. And this is the happineſſe of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that have attained the fruition of the Samplar of things. But our minds, becauſe of their informitie, doe often forget the things they knew, though there remaine the concreated aptitude to know them again. For although they cannot without a body, be ſtirred up to an intellectuall progreſſe; yet becauſe of their careleſſeneſſe, averſions from the object, and diſtractions to divers and ſundry things, and becauſe of the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubles, they loſe their notions. For the notions that we get here, in this variable and unſtable world, according to the conditions thereof, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. For they are as the notions of Schollers and learners, that begin to profit, but are not yet brought to the Maſtery: But the notions here acquired,<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115053:84"/>when the minde proceedeth from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable world to the unyariable, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tranſlated to the invariable maſtery: For when particular notions paſs into the perfect maſtery, they ceaſe to be variable in the univerſall maſtery, which before were particularly fluid and unfrable. So we are in this world docible, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught in the other, we are Maſters.</p>

                  <p>IT now remaines that thou ſpeak what thou thinkeſt of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of our minde, that being inſtructed concerning it, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as may be in one day; I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that I have profited in ſo many things.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Id.</speaker>
                  <p>They that make the intellectabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the element or beginning of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the underſtanding, doe not think that the minde depends of the body. And they that make reaſon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115053:85"/>of the aſcent of the underſtanding, and intellectability the end, doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the mind dies with the body. But I cannot imagine that they who have any taſte of wiſdome, would ever deny the immortality of the mind; as I have already, as things came then into my mind, made it plaine to the Orator. So he which conſiders, that the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mind reacheth to that which is invariable, and that by the mind, forms are abſtracted from variability, and are tranſlated, into the invariable region of the neceſſity of complexion, he cannot doubt, but the nature of the minde is free from all variability. For it attracts to it ſelfe, what it abſtracts from varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; for the invariable touch of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometricall figures, is found not in pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in the minde. And as long as the ſoul enquires and ſeekes through Organs, that which it finds is variable: but that which it finds, when it ſeekes by it ſelfe, is ſtable, cleare, bright, and fixed; and conſequently not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things variable, which it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by ſenſe, but of things invariable, which it findeth by it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:115053:85"/>Moreover the demonſtration of the immortality of the minde, may be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out by number; for being a living number, that is a number numbering, and every number incorruptible in it ſelfe, although conſidered in variable matter, it ſeeme variable; the number of our minde cannot be conceived cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible; how then can the Author of an incorruptible numbe ſeeme corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Nor can any number evacuate the power of the mindes numbering. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas the motion of Heaven is numbered by the minde, and time is the meaſure of motion; time it ſelfe ſhall never evacuate the power of the mind, but that it ſhall abide as the terme, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and determination of all things meaſureable. The inſtruments of the heavenly motions, proceeding from the minde of man, doe plainly ſhew, that motion doth not ſo much meaſure the minde, as the minde meaſures motion; ſo that the minde by its intellective mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeemes to complicate all ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motion, the mind puts forth of it ſelf the diſcurſive motion, &amp; ſo it is the form of moving; ſeeing then whatſoever is <pb n="166" facs="tcp:115053:86"/>diſſolved, is diſſolved by motion, how ſhould then the forme of moving be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by motion? The minde being the intelluali life, moving it ſelfe, that is, putting forth its life, that is, its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; how can it chuſe but live alwaies ? A motion moving it ſelf, how can it ever faile? for it hath life inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately conjoyned, by which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes living; even as aſphear which is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>waies round, by a circle compact unto it.</p>
                  <p>If the compoſition of the minde bee the ſame, with a number compounded of it ſelfe; how is it poſſible to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into that which is no minde? So if the minde be the coincidence of unity, and alterity, as number, how is it divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,? ſeeing that in it diviſibility co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſides with indiviſible unity, if the minde doe complicate the ſame and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as underſtanding, diviſibly and unitively, how ſhall it be deſtroyed? If number be the manner of the minds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtanding, and in its numbring expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, coincide with complication; how ſhall it faile? for that power hat in explicating complicates, as it is manifeſt the minde doth, cannot bee<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115053:86"/>made leſſe; for hee that numbers expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the power of unity, and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates number into unity, for a denary is a unity complicated of ten; ſo hee who numbereth , doth both explicate and complicate.</p>
                  <p>The minde is the image of eternity, but time the explication. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is alwayes leſſe then the image of the complication of eternity. Now he who notes the jndgement of the minde concreated with it, by which it judgeth of all reaſons, and that reaſons are from the minde, ſees that no reaſon can reach to the meaſure of the minde, Our minde therefore remaines unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, infinible, and in terminable by any reaſon, which onely the uncreated minde meaſureth, terminateth and boundeth, as the truth doth its living image, which is of it, in its and by it. How ſhould the image periſh, which is the reſpendence of incorruptible truth, unleſſe the truth ſhould aboliſh and put out its ſhining brightneſſe, and reſplendence. As therefore it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that infinite truth ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw its communicated reſplendence,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115053:87"/>becauſe it is infinite goodneſſe; ſo it is impoſſible that the image thereof, which is nothing but the conmunicatd reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, ſhould ever faile; as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that when the Sun by his ſhining hath made day, it ſhould ever ceaſe to be day, till the Sun leave ſhining. The Chriſtian religinon likewiſe which hath this yeare brought this innumerable people to <hi>Rome,</hi> and thee,
<hi>Philoſopher</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a vehement admiration of them, which hath alwaies appeared in the world, though in diverſity of manners, proves that the immortality of our minde, is naturally implanted in us, as the humanity of our nature; for we have no more certaine knowledge that we are men, then that wee have immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mind, when the knowledge of both, is the common aſſertion of men. And theſe things thus ſpoken by an <hi>Idiot,</hi> I pray thee take in good part; and if they be not ſuch, as thou upon the <hi>Orators</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, didſt think to have heard, yet ſome thing there may be, which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture may bring thee ſome helpe to higher things.</p>

               <p>Yes truely, for the ſame greatneſſe of whatſoever things are divers, never hath the ſame weight. Therefore there being one weight of blood, and another of the Urine; and of both theſe, one in a ſound man, and another in a ſick man; one in an old man, another in a young man; one in a German, another in an African, were it not very convenient for a Phyſitian, to have-all theſe differences noted?</p>

               <p>For I conceive a Phyſician might give a truer judgement of the Urin, by the weight and colour both together, then by the deceitfull colour alone.</p>

               <p>I thinke the vertue of the Load-ſtone might be weighed, if putting ſome Iron in one ſcale, and a Load-ſtone in the other, untill the ballance were even, then taking away the Load-ſtone, and ſome other thing of the ſame weight being put into the ſcale, the Load-ſtone were holden over the Iron, ſo that that ſcale wou'd begin to riſe; by reaſon of the Load-ſtones attraction of the Iron, then take out ſome of the weight of the other ſcale, untill the ſcale wherein the Iron is, doe ſinke againe to the aequilibrium, or equality ſtill hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Load-ſtone unmovable as it was; I beleeve that by weight of what was taken out of the contrary ſcale, one might come proportionably to the weight of the vertue or power of the Load-ſtone. And in like manner, the verture of a Diamond, might be found
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115053:96"/>hereby, becauſe they ſay it hinders the Load-ſtone form drawing of Iron; and ſo other vertues of other ſtones, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, being alwayes had of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the bodyes, becauſe in a greater body, there is a greater power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>

               <p>In all I thinke. For weighing a<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115053:97"/>piece of Wood, and then burning it throughly, and then weighing the aſhes, it is knowne how much water there was in the wood, for there is nothing that hath a heavie weight but water and earth. It is knowne moreover by the divers weight of wood in aire, water and oyle, how much the water that is in wood, is heavier or lighter then clean ſpring water, and ſo how much aire there is in it. So by the diverſity of the weight of aſhes, how much fire there is in them: and of the Elemens may bee gotten by a nearer conjecture, though preciſion be alwayes inattingible. And as I have ſaid, of Wood, ſo may be done with Herbs, fleſh and other things.</p>

               <p>If a man ſhould put an hundred weight of earth into a great earthen pot, and then ſhould take ſome Herbs, and Seeds, &amp; weigh them, and then plant or ſow them in that pot, and then ſhould let them grow there ſo long, untill hee had ſucceſſively by little and little, got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an hundred weight of them, hee<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115053:97"/>would finde the earth but very little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, when he came to weigh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: by which he might gather, that all the aforeſaid herbs, had their weight from the water. Therefore the waters being ingroſſed (or impregnated) in the earth, attracted a terreſtreity, and by the opperation of the Sunne, upon the Herb were condenſed (or were condenſed into an Herb.) If thoſe Herbs bee then burn't to aſhes, mayeſt not thou gueſſe by the diverſity of the weights of all; How much earth thou founderſt more then the hundred weight, and then conclude that the water brought all that? For the Elements are convertible one into another by parts, as wee finde by a glaſs put into the ſnow, where wee ſhall ſee the aire condenſed into water, and flowing in the glaſs. So wee finde by experience, that ſome water is turned into ſtones, as ſome is into Ice; and that there is in ſome fountaines a hardening and petrifying vertue, which turnes the things that are put into them, into ſtone. For ſo ſay they, there is a certaine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter found in

               <p>If a man ſhould doe this, in divers towers of an equall height, and at divers times, he might come neare a likely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. But yet he might ſooner reach the weight of the aire, by the diverſity of figures or ſhapes, in things of equall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe. As if I would let one pound of lead fall from a high tower, that were round, and take the water that ran from<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115053:99"/>an hour-glaſs in the meane time; &amp; then would do the ſame againe with the like weight of lead, that were broad, letting the water run in like manner: I might by the divers weights of the waters, reach to the weight of the aire: For we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that birds doe abide more ſtill when they ſpread their wings, becauſe they take up more aire; as alſo that which is heavie, doth ſooner ſink in the water, if it be round, then if it be ſquare. And peradventure the aire may yet be more eaſily weighed: as if equall bellows. were equally filled, in divers times and places, for by the motion of thoſe equall bellows, water being dropped through an hour-glaſs, by an equall height, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the motion, and that weighed, by the proportion of water to water, of the divers times and places, it might be eaſily known. For looke in what proportion the more ponderous water did exceed, in the ſame proportion did the lightneſſe of the aire of that bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, exceed the lightneſſe of the other bellows, whoſe water weighed leſſe.</p>
               <p>But the beſt way of al, is to take an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty glaſſe full of aire, ſuppoſe the glaſſe<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115053:100"/>weigh juſt a pound, if then ſtoping the hole with wax, thou put it down into the water, and that one pound weight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, will hold it down under water, being laid upon it, then thou mayſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſay, that the aire in the glaſs is of the lightneſſe of two pounds. So mayſt thou know very near, the proportion of the lightnſſe of on ayre to another, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, times and regions.</p>
               <p>By the like device alſo, by rneanes of a bellows, maiſt thou weigh ſmoak or winde: for if thou take a bellows full of aire, and then ſhut them in the ſmoak, preſſing out the aire, and after pull them open, the ſmoake will fill the bellows, which thou mayeſt weigh as aire, and ſo make tryall whether ſmoak or aire bee lighter, and by how much: and ſo mayeſt thou doe with winde. Thou mighteſt alſo by the motion of the ſmoak, whileſt ſo many droppes of water diſtill in the hour-glaſs, and the motion of fire, during the diſtillig of ſo many drops, gueſſe at the lightneſs of fire, above ſmoak, or aire. No, whatſoever we have ſaid of water-hour-glaſſes, may perhaps be better try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sand-hour-glaſſes, made of glaſſe,<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115053:100"/>or ſome fine earth, with one hole in the top, and another narrow one in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the veſſell, that may be ſtopped with wax, or with ones finger, untill the very inſtant, that the tryall of weights were to be made: then opening the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hole in the bottome, and taking the ſand that runs into the baſon, during the time of the motion of the light or heavie things; if the ſand be weighed as I ſaid of the water, by the weight of one ſand to another, the weight of things might be knowne by a very neare gueſſe. And as by the foreſaid devices by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of figures, the weight of the aire might be conjectured; ſo of the water likewiſe, and on the other ſide, the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous capacity of figures or ſhapes.</p>

               <p>Thou ſayeſt true, though in this caſe there be great need of a diligent diſcourſe, for if any man noting a fixed ſtar in the Meridionall line, would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and note the water, running from the hour-glaſs, untill the returne of the ſame ſtar to the ſame place, and would doe the like with the ſun from his riſing, to his riſing again the next day, he might finde the motion of the ſun to the eaſt, by the diverſity of the leſſer-neſſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters weight, of the ſtars motion from the meridional line, to its return to the ſame place, reſpectively to the motion of the Sun, from his riſing to his riſing, for by how much leſſe it were by ſo much, leſſe in compariſon to the weight of the whole, were the motion in order to the equinoctiall circle, not to the Zodiack, which is not deſcribed upon the poles of the world, but its owne. So if any man would by the ſame ſtarre try, how much the Sun were moved in fifteen dayes, he might doe it in the ſame manner, by the divers diſtance of the Suns riſing reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively to the place of that ſtar in the<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115053:103"/>Meridian line, As for example, if to day the diſtance of the place of that ſtar, in the line from the Suns riſing, be found in ſome proportion by the hour-glaſs, to the weight of the water of the whole revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtar; and in fifteen dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it be found in another proportion, by the diverſity of theſe porportions the motion might be proved, ſo it be alwaies in the equinoctiall.</p>

               <p>Yes, generally all harmonicall concords are moſt ſubtilly found out by weights: yea, the weight of a thing is properly the harmonicall proportion, ariſing from the various combination of divers things. Alſo the friendſhips and enmities of living Creatures, and of men of the ſame ſpecies, and whatſoever elſe, is weighed by harmonicall concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances and contrary diſſonances: So the health of a man is weighed by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſickneſſe by that which is contrary to harmony; nay, after the ſame manner alſo, lightneſſe and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, prudence and ſimplicity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch things, if thou marke diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

               <p>I thinke the neareſt proportions of the circle, and the ſquare, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which belong to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the capacity of figures, may<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115053:107"/>fitly be proved by weights, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes. For, if thou make a veſſell like a column of a known Diameter and height, and another like a Cube of the ſame Diameter and height, and then fill them both with water, and weigh the water; by the diverſity of weights will appeare unto thee, the propoſition of the ſquare to the circle. And by this meanes thou mayſt give a gueſſe at the ſquaring of a circle, and whatſoever, about this, thou deſireſt to know. So if thou take too equall plates, and bending one of them round into a circle, make thereof a piller-faſhioned veſſell; and of the other makeſt a cubick ſquare one, and then filleſt theſe veſſells with water; Thou ſhalt by the differing weights of water, know the different capacity of a circle, and a ſquare of the ſame circumference. So having many ſuch plates every way equall, thou mayſt ſearch the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the capacities in a triangled, a five cornered, a ſix cornered veſſell, and ſo forth. In like manner, by weight thou mayſt come to the knowledge of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of veſſells, of what ſhape ſoever; and to inſtruments of meaſuring and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115053:108"/>weighing. How Ballances are made. How one pound weight can life up a thouſand, by the diſtance thereof from the Center, and the various deſcent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraight or crooked. And how all the ſubtill inſtruments of Ships, and other engines ought to bee made. And therefore I thinke this ſtatick know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge very profitable, for whatſoever belongs to Geometry. Thou mayſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if thou wilt, and beeſt crurious weigh, the numbers of Haires, Leaves, Graines, Sands, in one buſhell, or of any thing elſe, if putting a ſmall quantity in the Ballance, and taking the weight and number of them, thou afterward weigh the whole. For by the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of weight to weight, thou mayſt know the proportion of number to number.</p>
